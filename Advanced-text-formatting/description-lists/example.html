    <!-- Explanation -->
    <!-- Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types â€” <dl>; 
    in addition each term is wrapped in a <dt> (description term) element, 
    and each description is wrapped in a <dd> (description definition) element. 
    Let's finish marking up our example: -->

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>soliloquy</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their
        inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the
        audience (but not to other characters.)
      </dd>
      <dt>monologue</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
        with the audience and any other characters present.

      <dt>aside</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
        humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or
        piece of additional background information.
