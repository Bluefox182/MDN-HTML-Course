      and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a
      hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma
      of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic
      fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of
      outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7
      kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F).[1] The plasma between galaxies accounts
      for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a
      number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a
      temperature of millions of kelvins.[2] Local concentrations of matter have
      condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass
      in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which
      interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic
      forces.[3][4] Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in
      the observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is
      poorly understood.[5][6] Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume
      of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost
      entirely of empty space.
