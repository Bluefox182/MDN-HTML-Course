    <!-- Non-semantic wrappers -->

    <!-- <span> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example: -->
    <p>
      The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing
      nothing to aid him as he staggered through the door
      <span class="editor-note"
        >[Editor's note: At this point in the play, the lights should be down
        low]</span
      >.
    </p>

    <!-- <div> is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site: -->
    <div class="shopping-cart">
      <h2>Shopping cart</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href=""><strong>Silver earrings</strong></a
            >: $99.95.
          </p>
          <img src="../products/3333-0985/thumb.png" alt="Silver earrings" />
        </li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Total cost: $237.89</p>

      <!-- Line breaks and horizontal rules -->

      <p>
        There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
        Who loved to write HTML<br />
        But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
        and his markup didn't read very well.

        <!-- <hr> elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text (such as a change in topic or scene). Visually it just looks like a horizontal line. As an example: -->



<p>Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.</p>
<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.</p>
